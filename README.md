# coin-catalogue-with-mongodb
MERN stack project where I have used React JS as frontend, node js/express as back-end and MongoDB as database. In the express js, I used the local images as link and used them in storing the links in database. Then made different request queries in node js,express. Based on the page in Front side, I created REDUX store and  made request via axios and got the data from database and showed them...

$ npm i
$ npm run server
This will start back end and after that open the Client folder and run:
$ npm i
$ npm start
