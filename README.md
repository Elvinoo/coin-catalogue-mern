MERN stack project where I have used React JS as frontend, node js/express as back-end and MongoDB as database.
In order to Run the project, after download, you should frist open the server folder with vs code(or Terminal) and run:
$ npm init -y
$ npm run server
This will start back end and after that open the Client folder and run:
$ npm start
